# ZOOKEEPER

## About
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

This project helped me to learn a lot of basic stuff such as some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.
It has a slow pace but if you are patient enough, you will end up with the joy of knowing a lot.
