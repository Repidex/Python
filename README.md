# Python
Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming.

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming patterns, among others.

## Interpreted Language:-
Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled one. This statement means that the original program is translated into "something else".

## Dynamically type
Besides, Python is dynamically typed, i.e., we donâ€™t need to define variable data type ahead of time; Python automatically guesses the data type of the variable based on the type of value it contains.

## Variables:-
Variables are used to store values in memory. We can store integers, decimals, characters, words or sentences in a variable. 
Python is completely object oriented, and not 'statically' typed. we do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

# Checking Instance Type with isinstance()
The isinstance() function checks if the object (first argument) is an instance or a subclass of classinfo (second argument).

## Its syntax is:-
isinstance(object, classinfo)

It returns True if the object is an instance or subclass of a class or any element of the tuple False otherwise.
For example:- isinstance(x, int)
