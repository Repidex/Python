# Python
Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming.

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming patterns, among others.

## Interpreted Language:-
Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled one. This statement means that the original program is translated into "something else".

## Dynamically type
Besides, Python is dynamically typed, i.e., we donâ€™t need to define variable data type ahead of time; Python automatically guesses the data type of the variable based on the type of value it contains.
