# Python
Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming.
      Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming patterns, among others.

## Interpreted Language:-
Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled one. This statement means that the original program is translated into "something else".

## Dynamically type
Besides, Python is dynamically typed, i.e., we donâ€™t need to define variable data type ahead of time; Python automatically guesses the data type of the variable based on the type of value it contains.

## Variables:-
Variables are used to store values in memory. We can store integers, decimals, characters, words or sentences in a variable. 
Python is completely object oriented, and not 'statically' typed. we do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.

# Checking Instance Type with isinstance()
The isinstance() function checks if the object (first argument) is an instance or a subclass of classinfo (second argument).

## Its syntax is:-
isinstance(object, classinfo)
      It returns True if the object is an instance or subclass of a class or any element of the tuple False otherwise.
      For example:- isinstance(x, int)

# Numeric Types
It is used to store numeric values. For example: x=10, y = 20.10, Amount = 15,000b etc. 
Python supports three different types of numbers, listed as follows:
            Int (integers)
            Float (decimal numbers)
            Complex (complex numbers)
      Integers are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.for example :- 1,2,,55,1100 ...
      Floats are numbers containing a decimal point (.). For example: 2.5, 14.2 ...
      Python also provides support for complex numbers of the form $\ a + bJ$, where a and b are floats and J's value is the square root of minus 1. Its real part is a and the         imaginary part is b.

# Type Conversion
During data manipulation, there might arise a need for converting an integer to float, float to an integer, float to a string, or splitting on a decimal point in a float.
      int(x) converts it to an integer.
      float(x) converts it to a float.
      complex(x) converts it to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part 0.
