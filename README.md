# Python
Python is very beginner-friendly. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know any programming.
      Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports object-oriented programming, structured programming, and functional programming patterns, among others.

## Interpreted Language:-
Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled one. This statement means that the original program is translated into "something else".

## Dynamically type
Besides, Python is dynamically typed, i.e., we don’t need to define variable data type ahead of time; Python automatically guesses the data type of the variable based on the type of value it contains.

## Variables:-
Variables are used to store values in memory. We can store integers, decimals, characters, words or sentences in a variable. 
Python is completely object oriented, and not 'statically' typed. we do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
      Example:-[Variable example](https://github.com/Repidex/Python/blob/main/Exercise/Variables.py)

# Checking Instance Type with isinstance()
The isinstance() function checks if the object (first argument) is an instance or a subclass of classinfo (second argument).

## Its syntax is:-
isinstance(object, classinfo)
It returns True if the object is an instance or subclass of a class or any element of the tuple False otherwise.  
      For example:- isinstance(x, int)

# Numeric Types
It is used to store numeric values. For example: x=10, y = 20.10, Amount = 15,000b etc. 
Python supports three different types of numbers, listed as follows:
           
           Int (integers)
           Float (decimal numbers)
           Complex (complex numbers)
     
 Integers are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.for example :- 1,2,,55,1100 ...
 Floats are numbers containing a decimal point (.). For example: 2.5, 14.2 ...
 Python also provides support for complex numbers of the form $\ a + bJ$, where a and b are floats and J's value is the square root of minus 1. Its real part is a and the        imaginary part is b.

# Type Conversion
During data manipulation, there might arise a need for converting an integer to float, float to an integer, float to a string, or splitting on a decimal point in a float.
      
      int(x) converts it to an integer.
      float(x) converts it to a float.
      complex(x) converts it to a complex number with real part x and imaginary part 0.
